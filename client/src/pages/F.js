         <h4>1 - BURPEES</h4>
         <img src={burpees} className='h-img' />
          <p>This exercise works your core, as well as your chest, shoulders, lats, triceps and quads.​

How to do burpees: Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart and send your hips back as you lower your body toward the ground in a low squat. Then, place your hands right outside of your feet and hop your feet back, allowing your chest to touch the floor. Push your hands against the floor to lift your body up into a plank and then jump your feet just outside of your hands. With your weight in your heels, jump explosively into the air with your arms overhead.</p>

         <img src={mountainclimbers} className='h-img' />
          <p>This exercice works your core, in addition to a slew of other body muscles.​

​

How to do mountain climbers: Get into a high-plank position with your wrists directly under your shoulders. Keep your core tight, drawing your belly button in toward your spine. Drive your right knee toward your chest and then bring it back to plank. Then, drive your left knee toward your chest and bring it back. Continue to alternate sides.</p>

         <img src={turkishgetup} className='h-img' />
          <p>How to do a Turkish get-up: Holding one kettlebell by the handle with both hands, lie on your side in a fetal position. Roll onto your back and press the kettlebell up toward the ceiling with both hands until the weight is stable on one loaded side. Release your free arm and free leg to a 45-degree angle with your palm facing down. Slide the heel of the loaded side closer to your butt to firmly grip the floor</p>

         <img src={medball} className='h-img' />
          <p>Adding a medicine ball to your burpee to increase the intensity of the exercise and boost your metabolism—all while building a sleek set of six-pack abs.​

How to do medicine ball burpees: Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, hold a medicine ball with both hands. Extend the ball up overhead, then slam the ball down on the ground as hard as you can, hinging over and sitting your butt back as you slam. As you hinge over, bend your knees. Place your hands on the ground outside of your feet and jump back into a high-plank position. Keep your body in a straight line. Then, jump your feet back towards the outsides of your hands so that you are squatting. Pick up the ball and press it overhead, extending your body and standing tall.​</p>

         <h4>5-Sprawls</h4>
         <img src={bosuball} className='h-img' />
          <p>The sprawl is basically a full body exercise that works as many muscles as possible and burns calories while shaping and toning upper- and lower-body, especially your abs.​

​

How to do a sprawl: ​

Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, squat down and place your hands on the ground. Jump your feet back to a plank and lower your body to touch the ground. Push yourself up to a plank and then jump your feet outside of your hands into a squat. Stand back up. ​</p>

          <p>Running at an incline rather than on a flat surface has been shown to increase total calorie burn by as much as 50 percent. Whether you're outside on a hill or at the gym on an inclined treadmill, start out walking for five to 10 minutes​

Try this treadmill workout: Walk or jog on an incline for five to 10 minutes. Maintain a jog for another five to 10 minutes, then pick your pace up again and start running. Spend five minutes running, then drop your pace back down to a jog. Continue alternating with five to 10 minutes of jogging and five to 10 minutes of running for 30 to 45 minutes.​</p>

         <h4>Rowing Machine</h4>
         <img src={rowingmachine} className='h-img' />
          <p>Just because you may not have access to open water, it doesn't mean you can't weave this fat-blasting cardio workout into your gym routine. Not only does using a rowing machine get your heart rate way up, which helps you blast calories and burn fat, but it also works muscles in your legs, core, arms, shoulders, and back.​

Try this 4-minute rowing circuit: ​

Begin with 20 seconds of rowing followed by 10 seconds of rest. Look at how many meters you traveled in that time. (Don't get off the rowing machine or even let go of the handle when you rest) Repeat this eight times, trying to beat your distance each time. When you're finished with this four-minute circuit, row a fast 500 meters and note how long it takes you. </p>

         <h4>HIIT</h4>
         <img src={hiit} className='h-img' />
          <p>Try this HIIT workout: ​

After a 10-minute warm-up, spend 30 seconds doing as many reps as possible of squats, push-ups, kettlebell swings, or single-arm rows. Then, rest for 30 seconds and do a different exercise for another 30 seconds. Continue for 10 rounds. </p>

         <h4>13 Strength Training</h4>
         <img src={strength} className='h-img' />
          <p>    If you've been lifting moderately heavy weights but are still looking to drop belly fat, it's time to pick up the intensity by using heavier weights and cutting down on rest time between reps, says Tyler Spraul, CSCS, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the head trainer at Exercise.com. "Lifting heavy is where you see more an afterburn effect. Your body continues to burn calories even after you leave the gym," Spraul says. Just be sure that your technique doesn't suffer as you increase your weight, which can lead to injury. If you're new to strength training, this 15-minute total-body workout is a great place to start.​</p>

         <h4>14 Walking</h4>
         <img src={walking} className='h-img' />
          <p>Yes, you read that right. Simply walking can go a long way toward helping you shed belly fat, says Sahmura Gonzalez, a personal trainer based in New York City.​

​

"It seems so simple, but 45 to 60 minutes of brisk walking every day can do wonders for your metabolism," says Gonzalez. "Plus, it ensures that you don't over-train, which can lead to an over-production of cortisol—a stress hormone that's been shown to contribute to belly fat."​

​

If your walking workout helps you unwind after a stressful day or work through emotions that might otherwise stress you out, there's a chance it'll help you lower cortisol levels, which in turn can keep belly fat in check, says Gonzalez. And brisk walking is an effective way to drop pounds—including the belly fat that's hiding your abdominal muscles. "One hour of rapid walking a day can lead to one pound of fat loss a week," says Gonzalez.​</p>

         <h4>15 Yoga</h4>
         <img src={yoga} className='h-img' />
          <p>Getting your Om on won’t burn as many calories as               a hilly run or lifting weights, but it can help build muscle and improve your endurance, which are all crucial for boosting your metabolism. Some of the highest calorie-   blasting yoga poses include plank, chair, Chaturanga, and wheel. New to yoga and aren't sure where to start?
